# Image_recognition_CNN
CNN to categorize a set of 10,000 test images into 10 categories.

<br>**Features**<br>
* I was able to achieve an accuracy of 81% at a reasonable runtime. <br>
* I incorporated model checkpoint to only save epocs that improve.
* I improved the CNN architecture by decreasing the amount of convolutional filters per layer and concatenated pairs of 2 layers before calling max pooling.
* I observed results with different droput values and chose best parameters.
